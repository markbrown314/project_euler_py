--- Part Two ---
It turns out that this circuit is very timing-sensitive; you actually need to
minimize the signal delay.

To do this, calculate the number of steps each wire takes to reach each
intersection; choose the intersection where the sum of both wires' steps is
lowest. If a wire visits a position on the grid multiple times, use the steps
value from the first time it visits that position when calculating the total
value of a specific intersection.

The number of steps a wire takes is the total number of grid squares the wire
has entered to get to that location, including the intersection being
considered. Again consider the example from above:

...........
.+-----+...
.|.....|...
.|..+--X-+.
.|..|..|.|.
.|.-X--+.|.
.|..|....|.
.|.......|.
.o-------+.
...........
In the above example, the intersection closest to the central port is reached
after 8+5+5+2 = 20 steps by the first wire and 7+6+4+3 = 20 steps by the second
wire for a total of 20+20 = 40 steps.

However, the top-right intersection is better: the first wire takes only
8+5+2 = 15 and the second wire takes only 7+6+2 = 15,
a total of 15+15 = 30 steps.

Here are the best steps for the extra examples from above:

R75,D30,R83,U83,L12,D49,R71,U7,L72
U62,R66,U55,R34,D71,R55,D58,R83 = 610 steps
R98,U47,R26,D63,R33,U87,L62,D20,R33,U53,R51
U98,R91,D20,R16,D67,R40,U7,R15,U6,R7 = 410 steps
What is the fewest combined steps the wires must take to reach an intersection?
